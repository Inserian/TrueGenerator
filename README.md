# TrueGenerator

The True Generator is a simple script that utilizes Random.org's api to generate a true random number. This script uses the axios library to send an HTTP request to the random.org API. The API requires an API key, which you can obtain by signing up for a free account on the random.org website. The script also sends parameters like method, params which are required by the API, and id is set to 1 as per the API documentation.

To generate multiple random numbers, adjust 'n' parameter.
